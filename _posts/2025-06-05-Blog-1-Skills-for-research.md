5 ESSENTIAL SKILLS YOU NEED BEFORE STARTING AI RESEARCH
======
in this blog post, from my experience, i want to brief share with you the key skills you should have before diving into reseach- especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a fascinating but complex field. It moves fast, involves both theory and practice, and demands a wide range of skills. If you're just getting started you need to have a solid foundation in the following: 

1. Coding Skills — Especially Python
------
Let's be honest: AI without coding like music without instrument
Python is the dominant language in the ML/DL world - and for good reason. It's readable, beginner-friendly, and has a massive ecosystem (think Numpy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and more). You don't need to be a software engineer, but you must be comfortable writting, modifying, and running code.
If you can't code, you won't be able to test models, process data, or even follow most tutorials. In addition, skills in using Github, AI tools, SQL, ... will help you a lot.

Tip: Start by learning Python basics, then move on to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Use Jupyter Notebooks to experiment and learn by doing. 

2. English Reading Skills
------
AI is global fields, and almost all high-quality resource are in English -from research papers to GitHub repos to video tutorials.
You dont's have to speak English fluenty, but you do need to read and understand techcical content. Waiting for translate version will slow you down and cut you off from the most up-to-date knowledge.
Tip: Practice reading documents, articles, and research abstracts daily. Don't worry about understanding every word - focus on the main ideas and keep glossary of common terms

3. Math Foundation
------
You don't need a PhD in mathematics to get started in AI, but having a good grasp of certain toppics will make your learning process much easier and deeper.
Important areas include:
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (especially derivatives and gradients)
- Probability & Statistics

You’ll see mathematical notation everywhere — in papers, course materials, and algorithm explanations. Understanding the math allows you to go beyond just using models, and into why and how they work.

Tip: Check out YouTube channels like 3Blue1Brown or Khan Academy to refresh your math skills in a visual, intuitive way.

4. Information Search & Research Skills
------
In AI, knowing how to find answers is just as important as knowing the answers themselves. You’ll constantly be Googling error messages, reading documentation, scanning GitHub issues, and exploring papers on arXiv.

But this isn’t just about searching — it’s about knowing what to search and how to filter useful information from noise.

Tip: Practice searching with specific keywords. Learn to skim abstracts, introductions, and conclusions of papers to see if they’re worth reading in full. This content will be presented in the next blog.

5. Self-Discipline, Planning & Balance
------
AI research is a long-term journey, not a weekend sprint. Without a plan and self-discipline, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, distracted, or burned out.
- You need a learning path.
- You need consistency, even when motivation fades.
- And you need to take care of your health and personal life.

Tip: Use tools like Notion, Trello, or a simple notebook to plan your learning. Set realistic goals. And remember — rest is part of the process.
