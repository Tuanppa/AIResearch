5 ESSENTIAL SKILLS YOU NEED BEFORE STARTING AI RESEARCH
======
in this blog post, from my experience, i want to brief share with you the key skills you should have before diving into reseach- especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a fascinating but complex field. It moves fast, involves both theory and practice, and demands a wide range of skills. If you're just getting started you need to have a solid foundation in the following: 

1. Coding Skills â€” Especially Python
------
Let's be honest: AI without coding like music without instrument
Python is the dominant language in the ML/DL world - and for good reason. It's readable, beginner-friendly, and has a massive ecosystem (think Numpy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and more). You don't need to be a software engineer, but you must be comfortable writting, modifying, and running code.
If you can't code, you won't be able to test models, process data, or even follow most tutorials

2. English Reading Skills
